Implemented a cross-platform application using the Dart language with the Flutter mobile UI framework. This application can operate on various platforms including Android, iOS, and the web. Flutter provides a real-time database that promptly pushes updates to users as they occur, which is a feature that synergizes well with Flutter's reactive framework. The application includes functionalities such as user registration, login authentication, order placement, order search and filtering, order acceptance and confirmation, transaction completion, review submission, and social chatting.
